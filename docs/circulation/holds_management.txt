Display Hold Types on Pull Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This feature ensures that the hold type can be displayed on all hold interfaces.    

You will find the following changes to the hold type indicator:

. The hold type indicator will display by default on all XUL-based hold
interfaces. XUL-based hold interfaces are those that number the items on the
interface.  This can be overridden by saving column configurations that remove
the column, *Type*.  
. The hold type indicator will display by default on the HTML-based pull list.
To access, click *Circulation* -> *Pull List for Hold Requests* -> *Print Full
Pull List (Alternate Strategy)*.
. The hold type indicator can be added to the Simplified Pull List.  To access,
click Circulation* -> *Pull List for Hold Requests* -> *Simplified Pull List
Interface*.

To add the hold type indicator to the simplified pull list, click *Simplified
Pull List Interface*, and right click on any of the column headers.  The Column
Picker appears in a pop up window.  Click the box adjacent to *Hold Type*, and
Click *Save*. The *Simplified Pull List Interface* will now include the hold
type each time that you log into the staff client.
