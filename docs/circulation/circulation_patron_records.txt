to checkout items).  These patrons may still log in to the OPAC to view their
accounts.

indexterm:[patrons, blocking]

*Blocked*: Often, these are system-generated blocks on patron accounts.  

Some examples:

* Patron exceeds max checked out item threshold

A notice appears when a staff person tries to checkout an item to blocked
patrons, but staff may be given permissions to override blocks.

retrieved.  Use the Other menu to select _Display Alert_ and _Messages_.

been renewed), the message will disappear automatically.

*Staff-generated alerts*: Must be added and removed manually. 

To add an alert to a patron account, retrieve the patron record as described 
in the section <<circulation_searching_patrons,Searching Patrons>>. 

Open the patron record in edit mode as described in the section
