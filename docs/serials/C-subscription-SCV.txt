Serials Control View
--------------------

Serial Control View is separate from the Alternate Serial Control interface. Serial Control View enables you to manage serials in a single tabbed interface. This view also enables you to bind units. Serial Control View consists of five tabs: Items, Units, Distributions, Subscriptions, and Claims. Units and Claims are not functional in 2.0.

Create a subscription
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A subscription is designed to hold all information related to a single serial title.  Therefore, each library is likely to have only one subscription per serial title.

image::media/scv-sub.jpg[Subscription]

. Click the Subscriptions link.
. Select the branch that will own the subscription.
. Right-click or click Actions for Selected Row, and click Add Subscription.
. Enter the date that the subscription begins in the start date, and click Apply. You must enter the date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
. Enter the date that the subscription ends in the end date. This field is optional.
. Enter the difference between the nominal publishing date of an issue and the date that you expect to receive your copy in the Expected Date Offset. For example, if an issue is published the first day of each month, but you receive the copy two days prior to the publication date, then enter -2 days into this field.
. When finished, click Create Subscription(s) in the bottom right corner of the screen.
. A confirmation message appears. Click OK.

[NOTE]
You can add notes to the subscription by clicking Subscription Notes. These notes are currently viewable only in the staff client by clicking on the Subscription Notes button.

Create a distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Distributions indicate the branches that should receive copies of a serial. Distributions work together with streams to indicate the number of copies that should be sent to each branch.

image::media/scv-distr.jpg[Distribution]

. Click the distributions link beneath the subscription. Right click or click Actions for Selected Rows, and click Add distribution.
. Apply a new label to the distribution. It may be useful to identify the branch to which you are distributing these issues in this field. This field is not publicly visible and only appears when an item is received. There are no limits on the number of characters that can be entered in this field.
. Apply a prefix to the spine label if desired. This information will display in Serial Control View when the items are received, but it does not print on the spine label in . 0.
. Apply a suffix to the spine label if desired. This information will display in Serial Control View when the items are received, but it does not print on the spine label in . 0.
. The holding library is filled in by default and is the library to which you attached the subscription.
. The Legacy Record Entry contains the MFHD records that are attached to the bib record if the owning library is identical to the distribution's holding library. A distribution can thus be an extension of an MFHD record. Select the MFHD record from the drop down menu.
. The Receive Call Number field is empty until you receive the first item. When you receive the first item, you are prompted to enter a call number. That call number will populate this drop down menu.
. The Bind Call Number field is empty until you bind the first item. When you receive the first item, you are prompted to enter a call number. That call number will populate this drop down menu.
. Receive Unit Template -  The template that should be applied to copies when they are received. Select a template from the drop down menu.
. Bind Unit Template - The template that should be applied to copies when they are bound. Select a template from the drop down menu.
. When finished, click Create Distribution(s) in the bottom right corner of the screen.
. A confirmation message appears. Click OK.

You can add notes to the distribution by clicking Distribution Notes. These notes are currently viewable only in the staff client by clicking on the Distribution Notes button.
