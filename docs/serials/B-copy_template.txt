Copy Template for Serials
-------------------------

A copy template enables you to specify item attributes that should be applied by default to copies of serials. You can create one copy template and apply it to multiple serials. You can also create multiple copy templates. Templates will be used in the Alternate Serial Control View or the Serial Control View.

Create a copy template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a copy template, click Admin -> Local Administration -> Copy Template Editor.

. Enter a Name for the template.
. Select an owning library from the Owning lib drop down menu. This organization owns the copy template. A staff member with permissions at that organization can modify the copy template. The menu is populated from the organizations that you created in Admin . Server Administration . Organizational Units.
. Click the box adjacent to Circulate. If you want the item to circulate.
. Check the box adjacent to Holdable. if patrons can place holds on the item.
. Check the box adjacent to OPAC Visible. if you want patrons to be able to see the item in the OPAC after you receive it.
. Select a loan duration rule from the drop down menu.
