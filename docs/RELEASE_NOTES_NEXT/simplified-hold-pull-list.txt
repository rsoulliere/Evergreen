Simplified Hold Pull List
-------------------------

There is a new hold pull list interface based on the Flattener service that's
designed to perform faster than existing pull list interfaces, both in staff
client display and printing.

Sorting
~~~~~~~

You can sort on any one column by clicking on it.  Click again to reverse
direction.  This is typical of similar interfaces.

Now you can also sort by multiple columns.  Right click the column headers of
the grid in the pull list interface to get a dialog that allows you to sort
by multiple columns, in any order.

Column Picking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The same dialog that allows you to choose multiple sort columns (accessed by
right clicking any column header) also allows you to toggle the display of any
column available to the pull list on or off.

Persistence
~~~~~~~~~~~

Once saved, your changes in this dialog persist for your user account.  Column
display, display order, and `sorting choices affect printing as well as
displayed output.
