New feature: loading sample data
================================
One common need for people evaluating Evergreen, as well as for developers,
writers, and testers, is a set of sample data that can be easily loaded into
the Evergreen database and provide a consistent set of results for testing
and training purposes.

This release features sets of sample data consisting of:

* 100 bibliographic records retrievable via a "concerto" keyword search
* 100 French bibliographic records
* Associated call numbers, copies, parts, and conjoined items
* Patron accounts, including some recently expired patrons
* Circulation transactions, including some holds and some overdue items

To load the sample data into a freshly installed Evergreen database, you can
pass the following arguments to the `eg_db_config` script (either when you are
creating the initial database schema, or as a separate call after creating the
database schema):

* `--load-all-sample`: Loads all sample data, including bibliographic records,
   call numbers, copies, users, and transactions.
* `--load-concerto-sample`: Loads a subset of sample data that includes just
  100 bibliographic records, and associated call numbers and copies.
