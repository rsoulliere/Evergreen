New features should be accompanied by a file in this directory. The file should 
be in asciidoc format and contain enough description to enable the 
documentation team to write something coherent about the new functionality. The 
name of the file should match the feature. No numbering, etc. is required. With 
each release, the contents of this directory will be appended to the release 
notes and removed from this directory.
