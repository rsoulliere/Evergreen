Warn When Adding to a Temporary Bookbag
---------------------------------------

TPAC has been modified so that a user will see a warning before adding
a record to a temporary bookbag.  This message serves to inform the
user that they are adding to a temporary list that will disappear when
their session ends.

A new org. unit setting has been added,
opac.patron.temporary_list_warn, that will enable this warning when
set.  Sites may choose not to display this warning.

The user may also set a preference in their search preferences to
disable this warning.  The setting only works when a user is logged
in, of course.
