Using Wine and the Windows client 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


indexterm:[staff client, installation, Wine]

One of th easiest ways to run a staff client on a Linux machine is to use the
Windows client with Wine. 

. Install http://www.winehq.org/download/[Wine] on your Linux machine.  
. Download the staff client from http://www.open-ils.org/downloads.php.  
. Right click on the downloaded file and open with _Wine Windows
Program Loader_.  
. Follow the same instructions as you would for
<<installing_staff_client_on_Windows, installing the staff client on windows>>. 

Building and Deploying an Evergreen Staff Client on Linux
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

indexterm:[staff client, building, Linux]

. From the Evergreen *server*, Navigate to the staff_client directory: 
+
[source, bash]
-------- 
cd  /home/opensrf/Evergreen-ILS-2.3.1/Open-ILS/xul/staff_client
-------- 
+ 
. _Make_  a linux staff client 
+ 
[source, bash]
-------- 
make linux-client 
--------
+ 
This will generate a staff client tarball called
_evergreen_staff_client.tar.bz2_ 
+ 
. FTP or SCP the tarball to your staff client
machine.  
. From your staff client machine, create a folder with the name of
your staff client and version.  
. Extract the tar files into that folder  
. Within the folder, click on the _evergreen_ file to start the program.  
+ 
Or, you can run the program from a terminal (command line). For example, if the
evergreen files were extracted to a directory called  evergreen_client_2.3.1 in
your home directory, you can run it with: 
+ 
[source, bash]
--------
~/evergreen_client_2.3.1/evergreen 
--------

Before you can connect to Evergreen from your staff client, you will need to
register your workstation when you try to login.

[NOTE]
===============
You will need the permissions to add workstations to your network. If you do 
not have these permissions, ask your system administrator for assistance. 
===============

. When you login for the first time, a red box will appear around your workstation 
information on the right side of the screen.

Removing Staff Client Preferences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


indexterm:[staff client, removing user preferences]
indexterm:[staff client, removing user settings]

Windows
^^^^^^^

When you uninstall the Evergreen staff client code from your system, the staff
client preferences and cached data are not removed from your system. This can
be a problem if, for example, you have registered your workstation with the
wrong library; or if you have chosen a display language (locale) that is broken
and will not let you start up the client again

On Windows, you can uninstall the Evergreen staff client code using the
Add/Remove Programs menu.

To remove the staff client preferences and cached data entirely on Windows,
there are two directories that you must delete completely (where _<profile>_
represents your user profile name):

* *C:\Documents and Settings\<profile>\Application Data\OpenILS*
* *C:\Documents and Settings\<profile>\Local Settings\Application Data\OpenILS*

You might need to change the preferences in Windows Explorer to display hidden
files (Tools -> Folder Optionsâ€¦ -> View).
 
Linux
^^^^^

To remove the staff client preferences and cached data from your user account
on Linux, there is one directory that you must delete completely: 

[source, bash]
----------
rm -fr ~/.openils
----------
