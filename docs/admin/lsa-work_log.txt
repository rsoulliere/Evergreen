Expanding the Work Log
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In versions of Evergreen prior to 2.3, the work log recorded check ins,
checkouts, patron registration, patron editing, and renewals.  In version 2.3,
the work log also records holds that have been placed and payments that have
been received.

In this example, a staff member has collected a fine from a patron.  To view
this action in the work log, click *Admin* -> *Local Administration* -> *Work
Log*.  By default, the work log will record the staff member's username, the
amount that was received, the payment type, the patron's barcode, and the
patron's last name.
