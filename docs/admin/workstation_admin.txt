~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[staff client, hotkeys]

All or partial hotkeys can be turned on or off. It can be done for a particular 
workstation:

To clear the existing default click *Clear Workstation Default*.

You can use the *Toggle Hotkeys* button, included in some toolbars, on top right
corner, to switch your selected Hotkeys  _on_ or
_off_ for the current login session.
It has the same effect as when you click *Disable Hotkeys* on the _Hotkeys_ menu.

Configure Printers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[staff client, printers]

Use the Printer Settings Editor to configure printer output for each
workstation. If left unconfigured Evergreen will use the default printer set in
the workstation's operating system (Windows, OSX, Ubuntu, etc).

Evergreen printing works best if you are using recent, hardware-specific printer
drivers.

. Select *Admin -> Workstation Administration -> Printer Settings Editor*.
. Select the _Printer Context_. At a minimum set the _Default_ context on each
Evergreen workstation. Repeat the procedure for other contexts if they differ
from the default (e.g. if spine labels should output to a different printer.
+ 
image::media/workstation_admin-4.png[printer context]
+
* *Default*: Default settings for staff client print functions (set for each
workstation). 
* *Receipt*: Settings for printing receipts.
* *Label*: Printer settings for spine and pocket labels.
* *Mail*: Settings for printing mailed notices (not yet active).
* *Offline*: Applies to all printing from the Offline Interface.
+
. After choosing _Printer Context_ click *Set Default Printer* and *Print Test
Page* and follow the prompts. If successful, test output will print to your chosen
printer. 
+

. (optional) To further format or customize printed output click *Page Settings* and
adjust settings. When finished click *OK* and print another test page to view
changes.

Advanced Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you followed the steps above and still cannot print there are two alternate
print strategies: 

* DOS LPTI Print (sends unformatted text directly to the parallel port)
* Custom/External Print (configuration required)

[NOTE]
====================================
Evergreen cannot print using the Windows Generic/Text Only driver. If this
driver is the only one available try one of the alternate print strategies
instead.
====================================

Receipt Template Editor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[receipt template editor]
indexterm:[receipt template editor, macros]
indexterm:[receipt template editor, checkout]

There are many default receipt templates included with the Evergreen staff
client. These templates are saved on invidual workstations. Customization can be
done workstation by workstation or by exporting the templates to import to other
workstations.

. Select *Admin -> Workstation Administration -> Receipt Template Editor*.
. Select the _checkout_ template from the dropdown menu.
+    
image::media/receipt-2.png[select checkout]
+
. This is what the default checkout template looks like.  The template preview is
on the left hand side.  You can edit the _Header_, _Line Item_ or _Footer_ on the 
right hand side.  
+    
image::media/receipt-3.jpg[receipt-3]
+
. In the upper right hand corner you can see the available macros by clicking on
the *Macros* button.  A macro prints a real value from the database.  In this
example, the macro _%LIBRARY%_ prints ``Prince Rupert Library''.  The macros that
are available vary slightly between types of receipt templates (i.e. bills,
holds, items). 
+
[TIP]
===============================
Receipt templates are marked up with HTML tags. You may use most HTML tags.
See http://www.w3schools.com/html/ for more information on HTML tags.  

You may insert a link to an image, e.g. your library's logo, that exists on the
web. For example, to inlcude the white Evergreen logo from this document, enter tag <img
src=http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/2.3/media/small_logo_white.jpg>. in the
receipt template.

There are several macros that can carry pre-built contents specific to
individual libraries. The contents can be set up in local administration. For
details see <<library_settings_editor, Library Settings>>. Though text can be hard-coded in receipt
templates, the pre-built contents will be automatically applied to receipts
printed from all workstations without editing each template.

* %INCLUDE(notice_text)%
* %INCLUDE(alert_text)%
* %INCLUDE(event_text)%
* %INCLUDE(footer_text)%%
* %INCLUDE(header_text)%
==============================
+
. Below are some example edits:
+    
image::media/receipt-11.jpg[receipt-11]
+
The above is the default _Line Item_ in Checkout template. The macro _%barcode%_
prints the item barcodes of the books that were checked out.  The macro
_%due_date%_ prints the due date for each item that was checked out. You may add a
line break between them: Barcode: _%barcode%_ </br> Due: _%due_date%_
+
The receipt preview will look like this:
+    
image::media/receipt-11a.png[receipt-11a]
+
[NOTE]
==========================
The due date can only be printed in the _YYYY-MM-DD_ format. 
==========================  
+
. Once you have the checkout template how you want it, click *Save Locally* to
save the template to your computer.

Print Holds Slip with Landscape Layout
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


indexterm:[receipt template editor, holds receipt, layout]

This feature enables you to use Mozilla-specific CSS to print holds with a
landscape layout. To use the landscape layout:

. Click *Admin* -> *Workstation Administration* -> *Receipt Template Editor*.
. Select *hold transit slip* from the *Template Name* drop down menu.
. Enter <div> before and after the block of text that you wish to rotate.
. Enter the stylesheet text in the <div> bracket that appears before the block
of text that you wish to rotate:  
+
[source, html]
------------------------
<div style="moz-transform: rotate(90deg);">
------------------------
+
. When you click out of this box, notice that the text in the *Preview* box on
the left side of the screen has rotated 90 degrees.
. You can further customize the look of the text by adjusting its height and
width.  The height and width that you specify will be unique to your printer.
For example, you could add the following height and width to your rotated text:
+
[source, html]
------------------------
<div style="moz-transform: rotate(90deg);height: 300px; width: 200px;">
------------------------
+
image::media/Print_Holds_Slip1.jpg[Print_Holds_Slip1]
+
. The holds slip will print with the configured text in a landscape layout:
+

Exporting Templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

indexterm:[receipt template editor, exporting]

As you can only save a template on to the computer you are working on you will
need to export the template if you have more than one computer that prints out
receipts (e.g. more than one computers on the circulation desk, or another
computer in the workroom that you use to checkin items or capture holds with).

. Click on *Export*.
+
image::media/receipt-17.jpg[receipt-17]
+
. Select the location to save the template to, name the template, and click
*Save*.
. Click *OK* to confirm.

Importing Templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

indexterm:[receipt template editor, importing]

. Send the exported templates file to the workstation to which you want to import
the templates. You may do it using memory stick or email, etc.
. On _Receipt Template Editor_, Click *Import*. 
+ 
image::media/receipt-20.jpg[receipt-20]
+
. Navigate to and select the template file that you want to import.  Click
*Open*.
+ 
image::media/receipt-21.jpg[receipt-21]
+

[TIP]
=================
By default all libraries use shared and hard-coded templates for Hold Slip and
Transit Slip. Libraries can switch to using their own templates by setting up a
library setting: Use legacy hardcoded receipts/slips. Details see <<library_settings_editor, Library Settings>>. 
=================

Button Bar/Toolbar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[staff client, button bar, customization]
indexterm:[staff client, toolbar, customization]

There is an optional toolbar with buttons providing quick access to commonly
used staff client functions. When activated the toolbar appears below the menu
bar. 

image::media/workstation-button_bar-1.png[button bar]

The look of the buttons can be customized. Use _Mode_, _Label Position_ and _Icon
Size_ on the _Toolbar_ menu shown on the screen below to select your preference. 

A group of buttons can be selected or activated by default for all workstations
at a particular library (see <<library_settings_editor, Library Settings>> for details). A different default
group can be set up on individual workstations by the following steps.

. Go to *Admin -> Workstation Adminitration -> Toolbars -> Current*.
+ 
image::media/workstation-button_bar-2.png[button bar 2]
+
. Choose a group from the list. 
. Go back to the above menu. Select *Set Workstation Default to Current*. The above
selected toolbar group is set as default for this workstation.

To clear an existing setting click *Clear Workstation Default*.

Circulation and Cataloguing are the default toolbar groups. Local system
administrators can create new groups for individual accounts, workstations or
all in a particular library.

. Go to *Admin -> Workstation Adminitration -> Toolbars -> Configure Toolbars. 
. Click *New Toolbar*
+
image::media/workstation-button_bar-3.png[button bar 3]
+
. In the prompt window type in a name for the new group, and then click *OK*.
. Choose the function buttons you want to add to the new group. Click *`-->(A)`* to
add. You may select one in the Selected pane, and then click *`<--(R)`* to remove
it.
. Check one of the radio buttons: *Owning Org Unit*, *Owning Workstation*, or *Owning
User* to specify the new group should be availalbe to everyone/workstation in
your library, or this workstation or yourself only.
. If you chose _Owning Workstation_ in the above step, click the down-pointed
arrow at the end of the _Permission Context_ box to select your library in the
orgnization unit tree.
. Click *Save Toolbar*.
. The new toolbar group will be displayed together with Circulation and
Cataloguing groups when you choose a toolbar group next time.
