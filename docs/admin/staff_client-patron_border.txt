Patron Border Color Enhancement
------------------------------

This feature gives librarians new choices for color coding patron penalties.  

In version 2.3, if the staff_alert column on the Standing Penalty Type is set to
True and no other more serious penalty (as defined by the CSS) trumps it, then,
when a patron incurs a penalty, a blue border will appear around the patron's
name.

For example, by default, the standing penalty type, ALERT_NOTE, has the
staff_alert value set to TRUE.  If I apply an alert to a user's account, and no
other penalty color takes precedence over it, then a blue border will appear
around the patron's name.

In addition, librarians now can customize the color coding on custom penalty
types. For example, librarians can create a penalty type and, using the CSS
classname PATRON_HAS_CUSTOM_PENALTY, apply a custom color box to the patron's
record.
